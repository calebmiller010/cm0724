# Rental tool point-of-sale interview assignment

Assuming you have maven installed, run the JUnit tests with the following command:

`mvn clean test`

ToolRentalService_Checkout_Test.java - End to end functional tests using the provided data and test cases from the specification document

CheckoutManagerTest.java - Unit tests for the core business-logic, the CheckoutManager. Displays use of mocking and asserting other edge cases.

Unit tests should be written for the DO / ObjectImpl classes, but it's very boilerplate code and did not see it as a requirement for this assignment. If this assumption was incorrect, please reach back out and I'd be happy to complete those unit tests.
